#  Climate Resilience in Agriculture  #
***

# Data Overview #
The dataset contains key variables describing various aspects of climate change, such as adaptation strategies, average temperature anomaly, CO2 emissions (total), crop yield anomalies (base years 2008–2015), economic impact and extreme weather events in multiple countries/regions. This enables me to monitor trends in productivity, environmental sustainability, and economic outcomes caused by climate change's impact on agriculture

# Objective #
•	Analyse the influence of temperature and precipitation as covariates on factors like CO2 emissions and climate risk.

•	Assess how climate risk affects crop yields and financial stability in agriculture.

•	Characterize the impact of successful adaptation technologies such as irrigation access and fertiliser use.

## Data Cleaning ##
Data cleaning involves handling missing values by either filling or deleting incomplete data points, removing redundant records, adjusting data types, and spotting anomalies to ensure accuracy. Standardization of measurement units ensures consistency, resulting in a reliable dataset for analysis.

## Data Exploration and Analysis ##
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) uncovers correlations, trends, and patterns in variables like temperature, precipitation, CO2 emissions, and crop yields to understand climate impacts on agriculture. EDA uses charts and graphs to find relationships and irregularities, guiding further analysis and model-building.

## Normalization ##
Normalization organizes data to reduce duplication and enhance integrity. Key steps include:

1. Eliminating Duplicates: Ensures each record is unique, preventing skewed analysis by removing repeated data points.
2. Reducing Data Dependency: Organizes data into separate tables, enabling flexible analysis without unnecessary dependencies.
3. Eliminating Redundancy: Aggregates repeated data, like country names, to save space and avoid errors.
4. Improving Data Integrity: Enforces rules, such as no null values for key variables, ensuring data consistency.
5. Creating Relationships: Connects related datasets (e.g., crop type and yield) to enable detailed analysis without repetition.

## Dashboard Development ##
Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize the relationships between climate factors, adaptation strategies, and agricultural outcomes using interactive charts. This will support decision-making, track adaptation efforts, and forecast sustainable agriculture trends.
